## Si5351-VFO

### Introduction
This is an adaptation of the excellent software by Nick Kennedy, WA5BDU to create a general purpose VFO that can be used as part of a homebrew SDR rig or to support experiments in the workshop.
Nick's original work can be found here: http://www.wa5bdu.com/si5351a-quadrature-vfo/
In this version, lines 512/3 have been changed to support the LCD I2C library v1.1.2 by Frank de Brabander
